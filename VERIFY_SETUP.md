## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Database Issues
```bash
# If database connection fails
mysql -u root -p
CREATE USER 'resq_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON resq_lk.* TO 'resq_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Backend Issues
```bash
# If port 3000 is in use

kill -9 <PID>

# If dependencies are missing
cd backend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Web Dashboard Issues
